# Race module for the Race model simulations
This is a module to simulate dynamic context-driven lexical activation and cloze responses, inspired by Staub et al. (2015) and Chen and Mirman (2012).
Use `help()` function to learn about what each function is doing and see `race_sample.ipynb` for a sample usage.
