# Race module for the Race model simulations
This is a module to simulate dynamic context-driven lexical activation and cloze responses, inspired by Staub et al. (2015) and Chen and Mirman (2012).
Use `help()` function to learn about what each function is doing and see `race_sample.ipynb` for a sample usage.



## Updates

9/26/2022

- Updated the default parameters in race_sample.ipynb based on Staub et al. (2015)'s experimental data.
- Updated the `race_fast` function to show progress in a better way.
